Here is my final project.  Wanted to write my own code as opposed to downloading some bootstrap.
Hardest Challenge? Trying to up load a working copy to Github!  lol  Getting things displayed where and when I wanted them.
Farorite Part? Styled Components.  Not sure if I am implementing them correctly, but really like having everything in one place.
What would I add?  The rest of the App!  lol  Price comparison and review ratings.
